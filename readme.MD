Running an **InitVerse node** is a great way to participate in the InitVerse blockchain network, whether for mining on the testnet or mainnet. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your VPS to monitoring your mining activity. Let’s dive in!  

---

## **What is InitVerse?**  
InitVerse is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to support scalable and secure applications. By running a node, you contribute to the network’s security and decentralization while earning rewards for your participation.  

---

## **Step 1: Set Up a VPS**  
To run an InitVerse node, you’ll need a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Here’s how to get started:  

1. **Choose a VPS Provider**:  
   We recommend using **CLOUP VPS 2 on Contabo** for its affordability and reliability.  
   [Get Contabo VPS Here](https://www.tkqlhce.com/5k117cy63y5LNMNPTTSSSLNRMOOPST?sid=medium).  

2. **Select Ubuntu 22.04**:  
   During setup, choose **Ubuntu 22.04** as your operating system. This version is stable and widely supported.  

---

## **Step 2: Connect to Your VPS**  
Once your VPS is ready, connect to it using SSH:  

```bash  
ssh root@<IP_OF_YOUR_VPS>  
```  
Replace `<IP_OF_YOUR_VPS>` with your VPS’s actual IP address.

## **Step 3: Configure Your Node**  
Now that you’re connected, it’s time to set up your InitVerse node.  

### **1. Update Your System**  
Start by updating your system to ensure all packages are up to date:  
```bash  
sudo apt-get update  
```  

### **2. Install Screen**  
Screen allows you to run processes in the background. Install it with:  
```bash  
apt install screen  
```  

### **3. Download the InitChain Miner**  
Download the InitVerse mining software:  
```bash  
wget https://github.com/Project-InitVerse/ini-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/iniminer-linux-x64  
```  

### **4. Grant Executable Permissions**  
Make the downloaded file executable:  
```bash  
chmod +x iniminer-linux-x64  
```  

### **5. Create a Screen Session**  
Start a new Screen session to keep your miner running in the background:  
```bash  
screen -S Inichain  
```  

### **6. Launch the InitVerse Miner**  
- **For Testnet**:  
  ```bash  
  ./iniminer-linux-x64 --pool stratum+tcp://<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>.Worker001@pool-core-testnet.inichain.com:32672  
  ```  
- **For Mainnet**:  
  ```bash  
  ./iniminer-linux-x64 --pool stratum+tcp://<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>.Worker001@pool-a.yatespool.com:31588  
  ```  
Replace `<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>` with your actual wallet address.  

### **7. Detach from the Screen Session**  
To leave the Screen session without stopping the miner, press `CTRL+A+D`.  

---

## **Step 4: Monitor Your Miner Activity**  
Once your miner is running, you can track its performance and rewards.  

### **1. Check Mining Activity**  
- **Testnet**: Visit [Genesis Testnet Pool](https://genesis-testnet.yatespool.com/).  
- **Mainnet**: Visit [YatesPool Mainnet](https://a.yatespool.com/).  
Paste your wallet address to view your mining activity and rewards.  

### **2. Track Rewards on the Explorer**  
Rewards are automatically sent to your wallet. You can verify them on the **InitVerse Explorer**:  
[Genesis Testnet Explorer](https://genesis-testnet.iniscan.com/).  

### **3. View Logs**  
To check your miner logs, reattach to the Screen session:  
```bash  
screen -r Inichain  
```  
Detach again with `CTRL+A+D` when done.
